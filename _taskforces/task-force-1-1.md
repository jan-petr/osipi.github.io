title: "OSIPI Task Force 1.1: ASL software inventory"
aims: Create an inventory of open source ASL packages
description: |
  The inventory is aimed at end-users looking for a suitable tool to process their ASL images. The inventory will list available open-source tools, providing information that will help users to select a suitable tool, such as scope of application, methodology, level of validation, licence policy, transparency, user-friendliness, and reviews by other users. Currently, all ASL pipeline developers are kindly asked to fill a [short questionnaire] (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf-4_pBXFA31htMNPZo1kQgcY0EJ5_AWxjyvkkYIQVGUHo6sg/viewform) to specify the features of their pipelines.
